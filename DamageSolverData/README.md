# Damage Solver Data

Extracted from the locally installed FINAL FANTASY XIV game files with Lumina.

- Every Phantom Job currently present in `MKDSupportJob`.
- PvE player actions, transformed/enhanced actions, and traits only; PvP actions are excluded.
- Combat statuses sourced by those abilities, including self/party buffs and enemy debuffs used as raid buffs.

`info.json` is English. The other files contain German, French, and Japanese game text.

`description` is rendered at the current level cap for that standard or Phantom Job. `description_macro`
preserves the exact game macro string, including every level- and job-dependent branch, for solver use.
Numeric IDs and timing, cost, combo, targeting, status, category, and source metadata come directly from
the installed game sheets.
